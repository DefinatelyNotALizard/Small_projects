Welcome to D.A.V.E otherwise know as:

Dynamic
Auto
Video
Enjoyer

D.A.V.E watches a user specified list of youtube videos to increase view count. This project was made to serve as the topic of one of my videos, I therefore did not spend ages on perfection. It works but make sure to manually reject the Youtube cookies when the window first opens, I don't know how to automate that I think YT has some jiggery-pokery going on to prevent it.
Please use responsibly, I  will not be held responsible for anyone who takes this overboard as this project was created mostly as an experiment/challenge to myself and was not intended to be deployed on a large scale. If you do, then any potential squabbles with Google are YOUR problem.
Otherwise feel free to improve upon this, I will be happy to review any pull requests.
Do not ingest.
